= JavaScript API =

The plug-in currently works with Firefox, IE, Opera and Safari on Windows, and Safari on OS X. The API is the same across all browsers.

== Methods ==
||boolean||`setDevice(int index)`<br>Select the game device the plug-in instance is connected to; returns `true` if a controller is connected.||
||int    ||`getDevice()`<br>Returns the index of the game device currently set.||
||boolean||`isConnected()`<br>Returns `true` if a controller is connected.||
||void||`setAutoPoll(boolean autoPoll)`<br>Normally the device state is automatically polled every time a property is read, which may be too slow for the older analogue interface. Setting this to false only polls the device when a `poll()` is issued, and the property values are taken from that time. (It may also allow for better sync in longer game loops.)||
||void||`poll()`<br>An explicit poll to the game device.||
||string||`getProductName()`<br>Returns the OEM name of the game device.||

== Properties ==
||int    ||x<br>Joystick x-axis||
||int    ||y<br>Joystick y-axis||
||int    ||z<br>Throttle (or z-axis)||
||int    ||r<br>Rudder (or r-axis)||
||int    ||u<br>Joystick u-axis||
||int    ||v<br>Joystick v-axis||
||boolean||a<br>`true` if the A button is pressed (the A button can be reassigned to any of the controller's buttons)||
||boolean||b<br>`true` if the B button is pressed (the B button can be reassigned to any of the controller's buttons)||
||int||buttons<br>An integer representing the state of all the game controller's buttons as individual bits||
||int    ||pov<br>Hat-switch, in degrees multiplied by 100||

== Embedding ==
For IE (or other ActiveX containers) the class ID is `3AE9ED90-4B59-47A0-873B-7B71554B3C3E`. For all other browsers the MIME-type is `application/x-vnd.numfum-joystick`. Sample code to follow.
